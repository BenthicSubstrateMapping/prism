Two data sets are provided with the toolbox for users to experiment with. The data come from 1) Patricia Bay, British Columbia, Canada, and 2) lower Portsmouth Harbor, New Hampshire, USA. All example backscatter data (.tiff files) originate from data collected by R2Sonic and distributed for use as part of the R2Sonic 2017 Multispectral Backscatter competition. Bed observation data from Patricia Bay are digitized from data presented in:

Bed observation data from Portsmouth (NEWBEX) are digitized from data presented in:
